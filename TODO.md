ideas worth to consider:

8. Move-sequence chunking drills (remember 3, 5, 7 move blocks)  

3. Blindfold memory delay mode: moves hidden for N seconds, then recalled  

14. “Name all attackers/defenders” square interrogation drills  

15. Blindfold game replay from famous games with checkpoints  

17. Post-session analytics dashboard (accuracy, speed, retention trends)  

18. Streak + weekly goals + consistency scoring  

19. Coach voice mode with short corrective hints, not full solutions
